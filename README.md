# BuddyPress Blocks

BuddyPress 5.0.0 introduced a new Blocks Category for the Block Editor to register BuddyPress specific blocks into. In BuddyPress 6.0.0, we plan to build our first blocks starting with a Block to highlight a specific single Group.

On October 10 (2019), we've published a [poll](https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2019/10/10/take-the-buddypress-blocks-poll/) to have BuddyPress contributors opinion about what blocks we should work on. Results are confirming one of our first feelings about possible blocks : using/migrating the existing BuddyPress widgets to build our first blocks.

As a reference, the master BuddyPress Trac Ticket for this repository is [8048](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8048).

This repository will house the development versions of the BuddyPress blocks that will be merged into BuddyPress Core once they are ready.

You're very welcome to contribute to this repository suggesting your Block Ideas or submitting Pull Requests.
